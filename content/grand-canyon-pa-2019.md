Our last trip to the Grand Canyon of PA and Centralia.

<!-- more -->
We made a weekend trip to visit Centalia, pa and take in some local sites.

If you're not familiar with Centralia, pa.... basically an underground fire of a mine forced the government to close down an entire town. I'm glossing over a bunch of details, but basically the fire started in 1962 and continues.

The whole town is a 4 wheelers paradise as there's nobody there. It's surreal to visit. Years and years go you could see smoke now and then coming up from the ground. It felt very... silent hill.

They finally closed off the road to Centralia, which is kind of a shame. It was a surreal place to visit. But evidently enough kids were partying there that they decided shutting things down and limiting accisibilty was best.
