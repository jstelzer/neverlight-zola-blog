This trip started off as a joke.

The spring of 2018 got warm fast. So warm that I joked with a friend of mine that we should throw the tents on our bikes and hit the road for a week.

Long story short, we did.

Rode out to the Kinzua Skyway here in PA, then gradually made our way north to Niagra Falls, then east across NY and into VT and NH.

Then gradually made our way home. Almost no highway riding, it was just back roads and random stops when the mood struck us.

I really need to do this again soon.
